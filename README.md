# Weather app Mobile ⚡

🗃️ This is a `✨React Native✨` project made with the purpose of learning more about this programming language.

## What I am using here:

```
🧑🏻‍💻 We do 🔥Typescript🔥
------------------------
💡 Axios
💡 Redux
💡 Dotenv
💡 Firebase
💡 React Context
💡 Async storage
💡 OpenWeather API
```

## Screens:

```
📱 User screen - here you just log out;
📱 Home screen - here you can see your weather for your default location;
📱 Locations screen - here you can search or select the location you want as default;
```

Pre requests:

```
⚡ npm install -g typescript
⚡ npm install -g ts-node
⚡ npm install -g expo-cli
📱 emulator of the mobile platform you're using
🗃️ create yourself an .env file and add:
    ☀️ your OpenWeather API key
    🔥 your credentials to the Firebase
        💡you will find the needed variables on ✨app.config.js✨
```

In orderd to start it just run:

```
⚡ npm run android
    or
⚡ npm run ios
```

## 🏁 That was it! 🎉
